# Doc PIXEorg

##  1.	Introduction
PIXEorg is a simple program created to organize and show in an excel (.xlsx) file concentrations obtained after fitting PIXE spectra with GUPIXWIN. Due to the variation of the X-ray production cross sections with the energy of the exciting beam, and to optimize the detection of the high mass trace elements with very low x-ray emission intensities, two irradiations are usually performed with different energies of the exciting ion beam. From the low energy analysis, the user obtains the concentrations of lower mass elements, and from the high energy analysis the concentrations of higher mass elements. After each irradiation the resulting spectra are fitted with GUPIXWIN and a set of comma delimited (.csv) files with the concentrations of the several elements and their relative errors is produced. The complete set of csv files (from both energy regimes) is read by PIXEorg which organizes and selects the useful data to produce a final excel (.xlsx) table with the concentrations of elements or compounds of interest and their respective errors.
